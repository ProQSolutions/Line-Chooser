# Line Chooser
An open-sourced app to save hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Simply tap the screen to decide between left and right. Since it's open-source, you won't need to spend $47,000 dollars on developing a similar app. Since it runs as a web app, you can use it on any mobile device or computer.
